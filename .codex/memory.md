# Codex Memory - AnyDayCard

Keep this short and curated. Prefer durable facts and "gotchas".

## Source Of Truth Reminders
- Code beats docs when they disagree.
- Update docs when drift is discovered during work.

## Repo Commands (Verified)
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`

## Product Invariants
- Template-first cards; no AI-generated artwork.

## Deployment (Observed)
- GitHub Actions contains a Fly deploy workflow on pushes to `main` (`.github/workflows/fly.yml`).
- If docs mention other deploy targets, verify current reality before acting.

## Recurring Gotchas
- (Add only when discovered, with file paths and symptoms.)

## Recent Notes
- (Append short entries dated `YYYY-MM-DD` when something worth compounding is learned.)
