# .codex - Compounding Agent Knowledge

This folder is the repo-local memory/runbook system for agents working on AnyDayCard.

Rules:
- Commit stable learnings and runbooks.
- Keep scratch output in gitignored subfolders.
- Keep notes factual and tied to evidence (file paths, commands, observed behavior).

## Layout
- `memory.md` - short, curated repo "gotchas" + decisions that help future work.
- `runbooks/` - repeatable procedures (research, implementation, deploy, QA).
- `logs/` - scratch logs (gitignored).
- `tmp/` - scratch files (gitignored).
